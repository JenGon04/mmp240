    <h1>Coconut Curry Chickpeas With Pumpkin and Lime</h1>
  <h2>By Melissa Clark</h2>
  <p>Canned pumpkin purée and coconut milk, heavily seasoned with curry spices and lots of fresh lime juice, make a sweet-sharp sauce for chickpeas. It’s a rich, creamy curry that you can eat on its own, or serve over rice or couscous. If you want to incorporate more vegetables, stir in some spinach, baby kale or sliced green beans during the last few minutes of cooking, letting them soften in the sauce.</p>
  <h4>Total Time: 30 minutes</h4>
