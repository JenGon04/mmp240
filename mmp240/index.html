<p>Hello! I am a current student at Borough of Manhattan Community College on my third semester. I am currently majoring in Multimedia Programming and Design. I am very interested in all forms of media such as audio, visual, programming, and even physical. I am currently working on semester projects as well as personal projects that demonstrate my skillset in these media forms. I hope to one day contribute my skills to a company or independant studio. I also wish to begin freelancing in my current free-time before eventually building my way up to my longtime goal of starting my own design studio or brand!</p>
